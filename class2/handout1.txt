To grab an element by id:

    var someThing = document.getElementById('the-id-goes-here');

Then you can do some fun stuff with it:

    someThing.setAttribute('style', 'color: blue;');
    someThing.innerHTML = 'I have tototally just ruined whatever this was before';


You can also grab all of some type of element:
    
    var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p');

    (Note, it is Elements as opposed to Element)

See how many paragraphs there are:

    paragraphs.length;

These are stored as what's called an 'array'.  We'll learn about those next week. But as a bonus,
you can access them like this:

    paragraphs[0];
    paragraphs[1];
    etc.

Each of those is a node that you can access the same as before:

    paragraphs[0].setAttribute('class', 'red');
